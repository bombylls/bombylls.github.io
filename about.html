      <h1>about</h1>
            <p>
              I'm Bee Wertheimer (they/she), a writer, narrative designer, and game developer based in Brooklyn, NY. 
              I belong to the inaugural BFA Game Arts class at Pratt Institute, alongside a Minor in Creative Writing.
              My work explores what it means to love and hurt—to <i>be</i> loved and hurt—and is always informed by my personal experiences. 
              I tell stories in the hopes that others will feel recognized in them.</p>
