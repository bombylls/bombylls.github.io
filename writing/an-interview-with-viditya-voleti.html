        <h1>an interview with viditya voleti</h1><br>
       
        <a href="https://vidityavoleti.itch.io/" target="_blank"><i>Viditya Voleti</a> is an award-winning designer of tabletop role-playing games. He is known for making</i> Bloodbeam Badlands, Space Goblins, <i>and most recently,</i> A Land Once Magic.
<br><br>
        B: When it comes to designing a game, where do you usually start?
        <br><br>
        V: In roleplaying games, oftentimes people ask this in terms of, “Do you start with a story or do you start with a game?” I’m a systems designer; I like to start with a game. I like to make little fun ways to interact first—with dice and cards and various other materials—and just see what mechanical frameworks are fun to mess with. And then I tend to build stories off of them. 
        <br><br>
        As a game designer, I take a lot from having a background in fine arts. I keep a sketchbook and I just jot down a bunch of ideas. So when I have an idea I tend to metaphorically flip through my sketchbook—various Google Docs and stuff—and go, “Ooh, this is an idea I have that I can take thematic points from,” or, “Here is a mechanical idea I had two years ago I can take from,” and like, kinda Frankenstein and collage something new from it. My design process is, “What am I interested in messing around with?” and following that thread until something forms.
        <br><br>
        I really like designing in threes; I like making triangles. I think it’s the most manageable yet complex number of things that people can juggle. Outside of just binary axes, like “good or bad” or “technology vs. primitivism.” This third axis adds a smidge more complexity. 
        <br><br>
        So, you have three mechanical points that are all pushing and pulling each other. Or, from a worldbuilding standpoint, I really like to make three themes—or three factions or three characters—that all fit at the points of a triangle. And they challenge and support each other, either literally or structurally. 
        <br><br>
        If you have all these different axes—even if it’s not something you actively tell players about—your game will just have a little bit more depth to it. A simple framework to add minor complexity that can snowball into much more dense things.
        <br><br>
        B: How do you know when a game is done?
        <br><br>
        V: Talking about this sketchbook—this junkyard—that I keep of all my games, there’s some stuff that I’m like, I’ve wrote enough of it to get it to a table, I’ve played it, I’ve experienced the story—or the mechanic or the joy—that comes from it, and it’s not gonna see release. It just existed with me and the people I played with. And I’m like, “That’s done.” I don’t really want to keep going back to it. Versus games that I just constantly have ideas for, and I struggle calling them done and finishing them. Even <i>A Land Once Magic</i>, which will be a printed book and a thing—I’m still very stressed about the idea that these words are gonna be printed and finished, and I can’t just edit a document and update it digitally. And even if I make a second printing, this is still a record of where it has been.
        <br><br>
        B: But it exists as zines currently.
        <br><br>
        V: It does exist as zines currently. But there’s an impermanence to zines that lessens the impact—the <i>severity</i>—of it. But it’s fun! I can pick up somebody’s zine of <i>A Land Once Magic</i> and flip to a certain page and be like, “Oh, you have <i>this</i> version of the game,” even though I don’t label what versions are what.
        <br><br>
        B: Like, there are some that are bound by thread and some that are staple-bound.
        <br><br>
        V: Yeah. Some don’t have a table of contents, some do. There are certain questions that I rewrote, so I can go to a question and be like, “This is the old version, this is the new version.”
        <br><br>
        B: Do you feel like one version is more legit than the other?
        <br><br>
        V: I think it’s always the newest version. At least for me. With that game specifically, every time it gets played and iterated on it just gets better. And I think that’s maybe why I struggle to see a game as done, because it can always get better. 
        <br><br>
        I like to design by play. Games are meant to be played, so you should play them to design them. And I often design in the midst of play. I try to bring something to the table as soon as possible—like as <i>scarily</i> soon as possible. So that game just keeps getting played and it keeps getting better because I keep finding new ways to mess with it and hone it in. A game is done when you play it and you’re like, “I saw nothing. This is it—this is where it needs to be.”
        <br><br>
        B: <i>A Land Once Magic</i> raised over $19,000 on Backerkit. What was the campaign like?
        <br><br>
        V: The game was already basically done—or, at least, a very playable version of it was done—for a few years now. So, the campaign was primarily to print it, get art, and fund a few other things. Promoting it was mostly just playing it, showing it around, and going on interviews. My role was being a personality. To be like, “Hey, I designed this game and I’m gonna talk about it and showcase it and play it!” To get people excited to know that it’s an easy game to jump into and it’s worth buying, and showing its versatility. 
        <br><br>
        It was kind of weird to take on a real market-y role, as a designer. Crowdfunding a game isn’t just, “Okay, you gotta make the game and then the game is done!” It’s like, you gotta get people excited to buy it and you have to kind of be <i>on</i> for however long—for us, it was three weeks. And you gotta be hustling. If there’s a quiet day: “Oh, did you post about it? Did you talk about it? We didn’t get any backers today, so let’s quickly see if we can grab one person. What market haven’t we touched?” It’s a very different side of making games.
        <br><br>
        B: Speaking of markets, can you talk about the impact of tariffs on the tabletop space?
        <br><br>
        V: Tariffs are ruining the tabletop industry right now. The majority of printing happens in China. That’s components, boxes, dice, cards—anything that makes a board game. Very specifically, American board game companies manufacture there. Some European companies print domestically, but generally the best quality and the best price will come from China. 
        <br><br>
        Let’s say <i>Monopoly</i>. A very basic, at-home, everybody-can-buy-it board game. Let’s say it costs $25 right now [it’s $25.75 on Amazon]. With current tariffs, it would cost $60-$70 just to buy a regular box of <i>Monopoly</i>. And that’s at the manufacturing scale of Hasbro, the biggest board game company in the States. So anybody outside of that level is unable to pay to get their games made. It’s not sustainable. 
        <br><br>
        We have to find new ways to do this. There’s a big European board game scene; so you either have to have a connection that prints the games and then pays European tariffs, so they publish the game in Germany and then distribute to an American market—which the majority of people don’t have access to. Or, you print domestically, and the price and quality here is <i>still</i> more expensive than if we just paid the tariffs. There isn’t a good workaround.
        <br><br>
        B: It’s not incentivizing American production.
        <br><br>
        V: Not at all! They want to bring manufacturing here, but that’s not possible because we don’t have the infrastructure. And whatever infrastructure we do have right now is too expensive to work at any retail scale. Even small business retail scale; it would bankrupt you. So it’s really tough. 
        <br><br>
        Roleplaying games are doing a little better because books are currently exempt. So we don’t count as “toys”—what counts as “toys” are cards, boards, components. But it feels very tenuous and scary. Who knows what could happen? If you wanna make anything that isn’t just a straight up book—if you wanna print cards, pieces, any supplementary thing—you gotta pay for it and it doesn’t make any sense. Like, God forbid we want dice. We’re a dice-based industry. Printing dice is gonna cost $4 a die, which is a crazy amount. The actual markup on that—would you buy a single six-sided die for $17? No!
        <br><br>
        B: BYOD, I guess.
        <br><br>
        V: Bring your own dice.
