        Watching the Wooster Group perform <i>Nayatt School Redux</i> was like watching a stranger dust off their grandmother’s scrapbook and impersonate the portraits within. For a moment, this leaves a dizzying impression: time folds into itself, a fascinating marriage of past and present until the two become indistinguishable. But the recreations are imperfect; a hand is raised at the wrong angle, an expression is miscalculated. And in this discomfort, in this noticing what the actors before you are not perfectly replicating, there is a moment of wrongness, a false but insistent impression that you know the stranger in the black-and-white film better than the actors who actually knew him, and have spent countless hours practicing their impersonations. It’s awkward.
        <br><br>
        The performance is itself an elaboration on the Wooster Group’s 1978 production <i>Nayatt School,</i> and it’s references all the way down. In <i>Redux</i>, moments from <i>Nayatt School</i> where fossilized actors read lengthy passages and recreate scenes from T.S. Elliot’s <i>The Cocktail Party</i> and other radio plays are “channeled” by the present actors before you. It makes you feel like a close-knit friend group you aren’t a part of had invited you to go out with them, and you’re struggling to figure out their in-jokes.
        <br><br>
        The Wooster Group encourages you to question the divide between reality and performance, and in doing so make reality suck. From the front row, the casually dressed actors are hardly ten feet away, glancing at an iPad with a trifold case. There is a sense of cheapness, from the crudely crucified television (I came in expecting a blurry but elegant projector), to the unrendered 3d model of a woman getting eaten by unrigged ants, to the absence of the most interesting prop from the original production, the stage building. I found myself transfixed by Spalding Gray’s beat-up leather satchel full of old vinyls, the only aspect of this performance that felt real.
        <br><br>
        I came in to the theater with a secret: I had read David Gordon’s 2020 review “The Forty-Year Rehearsal”, a loving tribute to the Wooster Group. It contained detailed accounts of months of rehearsals for <i>Since I Can Remember</i> (the first running of <i>Nayatt School Redux</i>) and deeply personal characterizations of the group’s members. I was an intruder at the Performing Garage, knowing far more about the group’s creative and emotional processes than the material itself. I understood their decision-making process emotionally, but I couldn’t fathom their artistic logic. I had caught a glimpse of a person naked and was now at their place of work and trying to be normal about it.
        <br><br>
        This knowing-and-unknowing is a tricky experience, a simultaneous exclusion and intrusion. I like to come out of performances asking questions, but I can’t say this whirlwind of a show made me feel anything other than dizzy.
