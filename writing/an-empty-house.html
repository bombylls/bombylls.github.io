      <h2>1/13/X4</h2>
      Constantly fighting to stay awake. Keep having the same
      nightmare over and over – he’s chasing me, he’s gonna devour me.
      I have a gun. I kill him. I kill him. I kill him. A clock chimes
      and I go through a door and sometimes I wake up screaming. My
      sheets are always soaked, endless loads of laundry.
      Caffeine used to make me jittery but now I don’t feel anything.
      Days are muddled, hazy. I only feel anything in those fucking
      dreams.<br><br>
      <h2>04/26/X3</h2>
      R came over and we made cookies. He flicked flour at me and we
      got into a food fight. He’s the cutest!! Afterward we went
      upstairs and did some stuff over clothes. Then under clothes...I
      went to the bathroom after he left and it hurt to pee. Like a
      lot. It was kinda scary but it’s ok now.<br><br>
      <h2>09/15/X3</h2>
      Got into a fight with R. Feels like he only ever wants to hook
      up. He doesn’t want me to touch him if I don’t want to which is
      nice. He really likes touching me, with his fingers and his
      mouth and his. You know. I feel dirty. I always shower after he
      leaves but it doesn’t help.<br><br>
    <h2>12/04/X3</h2>
      They keep asking so many questions. The bruising makes it hard
      to talk. I try to remember exactly what happened and I can’t. R
      is gone. Nothing feels real.
      I wasn’t enough for him and now he’s gone. I didn’t have a
      choice. They said it was self defense but it was a fight and I
      won. I am filth. If he had just called...he could’ve just
      called. He came in through the window. I can hear the thud of his
      body falling. Victory tastes like metal and smoke.
