    <h2>overview</h2>
    ANNOTA LINE is a point-and-click narrative adventure game about
a train heist. The game takes place in a fictional world where
gods exist on a spiritual plane that influences the mortal
realm. The player alternates between shifting the fabric of
reality as CYNACHOR, the god of medicine; and experiencing this
reality as SERAFIN, the heist leader.<br><br>

<h2>design pillars</h2>
POWER. The player should at all times be aware of their own power
or lack thereof.<br><br>
TELL A COMPELLING, EMOTIONALLY RESONANT STORY. The player should
relate to the characters, their struggles, and motivations. They
should be emotionally invested in the success of the heist.<br><br>
CREATE STYLISH AND UNIQUE VISUALS. The game should be visually
remarkable.<br><br>

<h2>deities</h2>
There are 10 living deities that come in sets of two. Their
power is reliant on the relevance of their domains in the mortal
plane, as well as their relationship with their counterpart.
(For instance, the gods of flora and fauna have long since
passed away due to humanity’s hyperfixation on industry and
disregard for nature.) Furthermore, the god of chaos can only be
as powerful as the god of order.<br><br>

SOVKA: god of order, peace, and
stability.
Iconography: hand, meteor.<br>
AKVOS: god of chaos, war, and
instability.
Iconography: eye, storm.<br><br>
CHY’RYM: god of life, creation,
and fertility.
Iconography: whale.<br>
MYR’CHY: god of death,
destruction, and murder.
Iconography: squid.<br><br>
LOSHT’OB: god of pleasure,
excess, and hedonism.
Iconography: rabbit.<br>
BOL’OSHT: god of pain, loss,
and grief.
Iconography: owl.<br><br>
NOTA: god of community, family,
and neighborhood.
Iconography: bee.<br>
TANO: god of self,
introspection, and
consciousness.
Iconography: tarantula.<br><br>
CYNACHOR: god of medicine,
science, and health.
Iconography: snake.<br>
CHORACYN: god of disease,
natural disaster, and decay.

<h2>world terms</h2>
ANNOTA: The city that the story takes place in.<br><br>
EGRO: The disease that decimated a chunk of the human
population before mysteriously disappearing
without a trace.<br><br>
NOVA: The drug created as an experimental treatment
for EGRO. Proved ineffective at treating EGRO,
but the drug is highly sought after for its
ecstatic effects. Highly addictive and
debilitating after long-term use. Overdoses are
common due to its illegal status and lack of
regulation.<br><br>
APHELION: The megacorporation that has monopolized the
commercial market. Rules the world via lobbying
international governments. The primary
distributor of Nova.<br><br>
THE SERPENTS: The gang founded by SERAFIN, of which ASTER and
FLICK are members. Named after their bar, The
Serpent.<br><br>
ANNOTA LINE: The luxury train on which the NOVA heist takes
place. Passengers are members of the ruling
class and security personnel. Contains various
APHELION shipments including NOVA.<br><br>
<h2>serafin titan</h2>
SERAFIN TITAN is the leader of the Serpents and the heist. She
has a commanding presence and is an expert in cybersecurity. She
is emotionally repressed, quick to anger, and generally severe.<br><br>
<h3>relationships</h3>
Despite her hatred of NOVA addicts, SERAFIN recruited ASTER to
THE SERPENTS because of his incomparable talents. She has since
developed a soft spot for ASTER which she is in deep denial of,
as he represents everything she stands against.<br>
SERAFIN pities FLICK, the youngest member of THE SERPENTS, and
finds them naive and foolish in their devotion. She is disturbed
by FLICK’S scientific fascination with EGRO and NOVA, but
secretly shares their curiosity.<br><br>
<h3>history</h3>
SERAFIN’S FATHER was infected with EGRO and won the lottery to
join the ANNOTA EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT PROGRAM. While in the
program, he seemed to be recovering, but after being sent home
and running out of his limited supply of NOVA he took a turn for
the worse. It became clear NOVA had done nothing but worsen his
condition, and SERAFIN witnessed her father’s deterioration and
eventual death in horror. After he and all the other program
participants had passed, EGRO and NOVA seemed gone for good.
Until NOVA mysteriously reappeared on the market, and became a
mainstream recreational drug.<br><br>
SERAFIN despises NOVA and anyone who uses it, considering addicts
to be making a mockery of her father’s suffering.<br><br>
Throughout the course of her father’s illness, SERAFIN had
become obsessed with computers. She grew especially interested
in cybersecurity systems, constructing and deconstructing
hundreds of simulations of real-life corporate systems, inspired
by the pharmaceutical system public takeover that occurred when
NOVA briefly hit the public market.<br><br>
After her father’s death, the only places that would employ
15-year-old SERAFIN were brothels. She worked at THE ORCHID for 3
years, facing severe physical abuse from her boss but gaining
intel on the inner workings of ANNOTA from her clientele. She
was ultimately fired for tampering with THE ORCHID’S scheduling
system and reassigning her worst clients to other girls.<br><br>
Using the knowledge gained from her clients, SERAFIN sabotaged
the security system of an up-and-coming bar called GLADIATORS,
created by rich kids from the countryside. After two weeks under
siege the owners agreed to transfer ownership of the property to
SERAFIN, which she used to found THE SERPENT. The game takes
place 4 later.<br><br>
<h2>aster fell</h2>
ASTER FELL is SERAFIN’S second-in-command in THE SERPENTS and
the heist. He is immensely charismatic and has a gift for
sleight-of-hand, manipulation, and theft. He is laidback, smug,
and unstable. He suffers from NOVA addiction.<br><br>
<h3>relationships</h3>
ASTER admires SERAFIN’S determination and organization. Despite
his affection for her, they frequently butt heads over his
addiction. He is torn between wanting her approval and wanting to
defy her.<br><br>
ASTER is amused by FLICK’S social awkwardness, but intimidated by
their intelligence. ASTER fears SERAFIN is going to replace him
with FLICK.<br><br>
<h3>history</h3>
ASTER was born to a prostitute who left him on the doorstep of
THE ALYOSHA FAMILY, who took him in as a household laborer. THE
ALYOSHA CHILDREN were similar in age to ASTER, and they often
played together until EGRO struck and ASTER and the other house
staff were no longer allowed in the presence of THE ALYOSHAS
without special permission. ASTER was subjected to physical and
sexual abuse at the hands of MR. ALYOSHA, which made him
suicidal. At 15, ASTER attempted to overdose on everything in
the medicine cabinet but survived.<br><br>
As they got older, THE ALYOSHA CHILDREN started throwing
parties, and when ASTER cleaned up afterward he found and used
NOVA. He was immediately addicted, and when he could no longer
steal enough from the ALYOSHA parties, he took to the streets
and eventually ran away completely. His upbringing of having to
make himself invisible around THE ALYOSHAS trained him to become
an excellent thief, and he discovered he was a natural at
charming and manipulating tourists. When he got bored of that,
he started stealing money from casinos, brothels, and bars. He
became well-known in ANNOTA and highly sought after by gangs. He
chose to join THE SERPENTS because unlike everyone else, SERAFIN
did not flatter him or promise him anything.<br><br>

<h2>flick hemlock</h2>
FLICK HEMLOCK is the newest and youngest member of THE SERPENTS
and the final piece of the heist. They are an expert in human
anatomy with strong medical and melee capabilities. They are
socially awkward, intelligent, and nervous. They are a devout
follower of CYNACHOR. They inherited a debt from their parents
and owe a large sum of money to a gang called THE NEEDLES.<br><br>
<h3>relationships</h3>
FLICK is deeply intimidated by SERAFIN. They feel indebted to
Serafin for taking them in, and determined to continue being
worthy of THE SERPENTS.<br><br>
FLICK envies ASTER’S social prowess and seeks mentorship in him.
They are also scientifically intrigued by ASTER’S addiction.
FLICK worships CYNACHOR, the god of medicine, science, and
health. They have dedicated their life to the pursuit of science
and it is their life’s mission to earn CYNACHOR’S favor.<br><br>
<h3>history</h3>
Born to doctor parents in the countryside, FLICK was always
fascinated by the human body and spent a lot of their childhood
hanging around the hospital. They learned about CYNACHOR and
CHORACYN through their parents’ patients, and soon FLICK became
a devoted follower of CYNACHOR. They graduated from medical
school at 14 and became a superstar in the field. As FLICK got
older and failed to “grow out of” their awkward and blunt
mannerisms, patients grew frustrated with them and their peers
accused them of coasting through med school with their parents’
help.<br><br>
FLICK’S PARENTS died in a freak accident when FLICK was 16. They
later discovered the accident was orchestrated by a gang called
THE NEEDLES after their parents had not made any payments on a
20-year-old debt. FLICK’S inheritance was collected by THE
NEEDLES and the remainder of the debt was passed down to FLICK.
They were forced to flee to ANNOTA with a new name. No longer
able to claim their credentials, FLICK used their anatomical
knowledge to study melee combat. They are recruited to THE
SERPENTS at the beginning of the game.
