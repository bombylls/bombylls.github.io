        This couch co-op arcade game was made with <a href="https://organzola.games">Drew Shapiro</a> in Godot for Global Game Jam 2025. I was the artist for this project. Drew did the programming and game design.

        The jam's theme was "bubble," and I immediately thought of children playing in the bath. All assets, both diegetic and UI, were drawn digitally with crayon-textured brushes and hand-animated for an imperfect, human touch.
