          A lot of games grapple with the ethical implications of the player’s
          capability—the player’s <i>destiny</i>—to manipulate their narratives.
          If you want to achieve the ending for the “genocide route” in
          <i>Undertale</i>, for instance, the game will condemn you every step
          of the way; the gameplay is tedious, the insults to the player’s moral
          character unending. But what if your very participation in the game
          immobilizes the narrative? What if you embody a barrier to the plot’s
          progression? <br /><br />
          <i>Needy Streamer Overload</i> (2022) is a cute, edgy, trippy visual
          novel about an aspiring streamer and various planes of existence (real
          life, cyberspace, heaven, and real, out-game life). Made by Japanese
          developer Xemono and published by WSS Playground, the game follows
          Ame, a young woman who struggles with mental health issues and drug
          abuse, on her quest to become a popular live streamer under the name
          KAngel. In <i>Needy Streamer Overload</i>, you, the player, are dubbed
          “P-chan” by Ame—because you’re perfect, she declares, and also because
          you’re her producer and partner. You are instructed to dictate her
          every move—personal and professional—and elevate KAngel to stardom. On
          top of KAngel’s follower count, you’re also responsible for managing
          Ame’s Stress, her Affection for you, and her Mental Darkness, all of
          which are impacted by the actions you choose to have Ame perform
          throughout the day. <br /><br />
          The game deals primarily with Ame’s objectification. KAngel is
          simultaneously hypersexualized and sexless—unable to have a boyfriend
          without public outcry but adored for her seemingly oblivious sex
          appeal (such as bouncing suggestively on a yoga ball, claiming it’s
          just for good exercise, forbidden from acknowledging the sexuality of
          the act). Her comments are flooded with declarations of her cuteness
          and her fans’ desires to meet her, to befriend her, to date her. She
          makes a living off of her constructed persona, her carefully crafted
          beauty, her fabricated nerd-loving personality. Only the player is
          privy to the real Ame, her sexual desires and her drug abuse and her
          disdain for her creepy fans. But the real Ame is nothing more than an
          object herself—every action she makes is dictated by P-chan, she has a
          private “tweeter” account visible only to P-chan, all of her thoughts
          manifest as text messages sent to P-chan. Ame is no less a commodity
          than KAngel, though Ame’s audience consists of only the player.
          <br /><br />
          Except here’s the thing: at the end of the game, you find out P-chan
          isn’t real. They’re an imaginary person made by Ame, a symptom of her
          obsessive desire to be consumed, a desire instilled by patriarchal
          capitalism: to be loved and dominated by a man (though P-chan is never
          gendered in the game, I always presumed I was playing as a man, and
          Ame only ever dates other men). If you take the time to replay the
          game the 27 times necessary to achieve all the endings—to watch Ame
          kill herself, overdose, leave you, have a psychotic break, hurt over
          and over and over, finding only pain at the end of her endless
          pursuit—you discover the “true ending” of the game is one that doesn’t
          involve you at all. <i>Needy Streamer Overload</i> concludes with Ame
          deciding she doesn’t need P-chan, that she can stream by herself.
          <br /><br />
          But what does the player have to do to get there? How many times must
          you feed her pills, fuck her, cut her wrists, exploit her? P-chan may
          not be real, but <i>you certainly are</i>. And you watched her suffer
          27 different horrible fates, 27 realities where she’s miserable or
          dead because of the way you directed her performance. In order for Ame
          to achieve liberation and agency, you must torture her relentlessly.
          If you want what’s best for her, you should have never opened the game
          at all. <br /><br />
          Is that the point, then? That the very act of playing the game is
          reprehensible? What does it mean to simultaneously be the instigator
          of the narrative and its inhibitor, Ame’s oppressor and her liberator?
          If you only achieve one or a few endings and then close the game, Ame
          never finds peace. If you torture her and yourself with repetitive
          gameplay, minutely adjusting variables just to fill up the ending
          slots, are you getting off on her trauma? Are you truly freeing her,
          if she spends all that time dancing for you? And if you’re like me,
          and you watched
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TETEWoPmz48" target="_blank"
            >a YouTube video</a
          >
          of all the endings, are you somehow worse for not putting in the
          effort? <br /><br />
          Maybe the point is that she can never really escape. After all, even
          without P-chan, she’s still streaming, still being gobbled up by her
          predominantly-male audience. Maybe Ame just never stops dancing.
