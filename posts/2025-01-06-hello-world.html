          This is (probably) my last winter as a student, and I still have yet
          to learn the lesson that I just can’t manage to get much work done
          over holiday break. The fall semester ended like any good book—so
          all-encompassing that when it’s done you feel like you’ve just soared
          straight off a cliff. My first use of now-abundant free time was to
          finally watch <i>Arcane</i>, which I’m still reeling from almost a
          month later. I’m certainly not the first to say this, but it’s a
          really good show. <br />
          <br />
          I ended the fall semester with my senior capstone project
          <i>Annota Line</i>’s systems all sorted out, so spring will be all
          about adding content and, like, actually telling the story that’s been
          rattling around in my head for months.

          is hard at work on the game’s art direction, meanwhile I’m…taking a
          break. To be honest, I’m scared to get back into the Unity project.
          It’s still hard for me to wrap my head around the sluggish pace and
          constant reiteration necessary for a long-term project like this—all
          of my previous games have been sprints, and this is a marathon, so
          it’s very easy for me to get sucked into a spiral of endless minor
          tweaks that prevent me from tackling the meaty stuff. I’ll start
          prototyping Act 1, Scene 2 in Twine, I think, so I don’t get
          distracted fiddling with the game UI. <br />
          <br />
          One thing I’ve managed over break: finally building this website. I
          was inspired by
          <a href="https://everest-pipkin.com/" target="_blank"
            >my professor Everest Pipkin</a
          >
          to make the transition to carving out my own tiny corner of the
          Internet, and I’m very glad I did! In this late-capitalist nightmare,
          every handcrafted item is a precious glimmer of humanity, defiantly
          persisting in spite of the ruthless corporate machine. As of writing,
          the website still only exists as a folder on my laptop, but if you’re
          reading this (thanks!) that is obviously no longer the case.
          <br /><br />
          So, welcome to my blog. It’ll be a strange mix of art criticism, short
          stories, and rambling posts like these. I hope you enjoy!
