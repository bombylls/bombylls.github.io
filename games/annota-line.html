        <i>Annota Line</i> is a point-and-click narrative adventure game which I am solo developing as my senior capstone project. I built the game in Unity and created its dialogue system using Pixel Crushers. The game backgrounds were drawn by <a href="https://annmarienevadaportfolio.com/" target="_blank">Ann-Marie Henderson</a>.

        <h2>process</h2>
        The game features a collection of deities playing tug-of-war with the fabric of reality as their rope. 
        This never-ending struggle spat out an addictive drug, Nova, that ravages the futuristic city of Annota. 
        You play as Serafin, a gang leader who has been anonymously commissioned to steal a large shipment of Nova.
        However, the job is bigger than you imagined, and you find yourself caught in the middle of the gods' affairs.

        <i>Annota Line</i> was showcased at Hex House in December 2024, and will be exhibited at GDC in March 2025. If you are interested in funding/publishing <i>Annota Line</i>, please email me at beewertheimer at gmail dot com.

Before working in-engine, I created a design document to build out the world, characters, and major story beats of the game, as well as design pillars to keep the game cohesive.
        I then created the dialogue system in Unity using Pixel Crushers, and drafted the script in Tinychoice before editing and implementing it in-engine. The game has been playtested on a semiweekly basis and iterated on based on player feedback.
