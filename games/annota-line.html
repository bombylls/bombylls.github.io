        <h3>narrative design, programming, level design, ui/ux</h3>
        <i>The gods are real and they hate you. The drug is irresistible. The heist is more than you agreed to.</i>
        <br><br>
        <i>Annota Line</i> is a point-and-click narrative adventure game which I am solo developing as my senior capstone project. I built the game in Unity and created its dialogue system using Pixel Crushers.  
        <br><br>
        The game features a collection of deities playing tug-of-war with the fabric of reality as their rope. 
        This never-ending struggle spat out an addictive drug, Nova, that ravages the futuristic city of Annota. 
        You play as Serafin, a gang leader who has been anonymously commissioned to steal a large shipment of Nova.
        However, the job is bigger than you imagined, and you find yourself caught in the middle of the gods' affairs.
        <br><br>
        <i>Annota Line</i> was showcased at Hex House in December 2024, and will be exhibited at GDC in March 2025. If you are interested in funding/publishing <i>Annota Line</i>, please email me at beewertheimer at gmail dot com.

      <h1>narrative design</h1>
      <p>Before working in-engine, I created a design document to build out the world, characters, and major story beats of the game, as well as design pillars to keep the game cohesive.
        I then created the dialogue system in Unity using Pixel Crushers, and drafted the script in Tinychoice before editing and implementing it in-engine. The game has been playtested on a semiweekly basis and iterated on based on player feedback.
      </p>
      <br>
        <h1>narrative development</h1>
        The premise came after a long summer spent analyzing my personal intentions as a game designer and storyteller. 
        I charted out my favorite games and their core features, and in their commonalities discovered that I enjoy curated experiences with linear, level-based designs. 
        From there I determined my goal with this project was to create a world that the player fully buys into and feels rewarded for navigating...but I still had no idea what I wanted the game to actually be about.
        <br><br>
        And then my friend said "make it a heist."
        <br><br>
        The heist narrative has already been perfected. Thus, my job is not to reinvent the wheel, but tell a fresh story through tried-and-true means.
        So, what story do I have to tell?
        <br><br>
        My dad had a major surgery this summer. For months I was utterly powerless, at the complete mercy of the whims of fate. I needed to make a game about that feeling.
        <br><br>
        <i>Annota Line</i> is a game about power.
