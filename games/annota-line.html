        <i>A train heist against the gods.</i>
        <br><br>
        <i>Annota Line</i> is an interactive fiction which I am solo developing as my senior capstone project. I built the game in Unity and created its dialogue system using Pixel Crushers. The game backgrounds were drawn by <a href="https://annmarienevadaportfolio.com/" target="_blank">Ann-Marie Henderson</a>.  
        <br><br>
        
        Play as Serafin, an upstart gang leader in a decaying cyberpunk city, as she leads an unlikely team against the most powerful entities in every plane of existence.
        Navigate rich environments with classic point-and-click controls, explore a post-epidemic city ravaged by warring gangs, and untangle a web of drug-trafficking gods and profiteering politicians.
        <br><br>
        <i>Annota Line</i> was showcased at Wonderville in May 2025, GDC in March 2025, and Hex House in December 2024.

        <h2>process</h2>
  Before working in-engine, I created a design document to build out the world, characters, and major story beats of the game, as well as design pillars to keep the game cohesive.
        I then created the dialogue system in Unity using Pixel Crushers, and drafted the script in Tinychoice before editing and implementing it in-engine. The game has been playtested on a semiweekly basis and iterated on based on player feedback.
