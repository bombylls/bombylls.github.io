        <h2>narrative design</h2>
        I wrote the narrative for <i>Gaia's Brewery</i> and created its dialogue system with Ink. In the game, the player interacts with customers, gathers ingredients, brews potions, and reads letters, while the shop slowly comes to life around them.
        <br><br>
        The game follows Emaline, a young nurse who leaves her life in the city to inherit her deceased aunt's potion shop. Here she meets various locals who, in exchange for helping with their troubles, welcome her into their small town and tell her stories about her mysterious aunt Gaia. Ultimately, Emaline must grapple with whether she is running Gaia's Brewery for her own sake, or simply following in her aunt's footsteps.
