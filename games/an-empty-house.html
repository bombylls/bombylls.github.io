        This 3D horror-shooter game was created with <a href="https://organzola.games" target="_blank">Drew Shapiro</a> in Unity Version Control. I was the narrative designer and primary 3D modeler on this project, while Drew specialized in the game mechanics, animation, and post-processing. We evenly divided the level design and programming.

        <h1>narrative design</h1>
        The story of the game is mainly conveyed through videos of me unraveling crumpled up diary entries, presented between levels. There are also various environmental features that convey the story even if a player does not read the letters. When furnishing the levels, I focused on the two settings described in the diary entries: the bedroom and the bathroom. The bathroom is where the character confronts their trauma, so it is eerily distinct from the rest of the environment and recurring in every level. As the levels progress and the player learns more about the protagonist and monster, the furniture takes on more surreal and dream-like qualities. The game culminates in an animated cut scene and credit sequence that I designed.
