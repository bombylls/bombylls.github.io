        This 3D horror-shooter game was created with <a href="https://organzola.games" target="_blank">Drew Shapiro</a> in Unity Version Control.

          <i>an empty house</i> began as two conflicting ideas: Drew wanted to make a fast-paced movement shooter with unique gameplay, and I wanted to make a horror walking simulator with a unique narrative. After a lot of back-and-forth, we determined the game's slowness could be its novelty: a horror-shooter, but the player can only walk, and can only hold one bullet at a time. For this to work, we determined, the gun had to be powerful enough to justify the struggle of only having one bullet. That one bullet must be able to instantly kill the enemy. But in order to keep the oppressive nature of a horror game, we figured the enemy must come back even more powerful after death. One killed enemy spawns two more. Thus, killing becomes the player's last resort.
          <br><br> 
          From this gameplay loop the story was born. The player character, an unnamed girl, is reliving the traumatic experience of murdering her rapist through a series of nightmares. Just as the act of killing punishes the player, it tortures the character.
